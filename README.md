# Neon Whiskers

Neon Whiskers is an all-in-one Discord bot designed to deliver a high-quality and customizable experience at an affordable price. It is built on a Rust backend and uses MongoDB as a database.

## Features

- Rust backend for reliable performance and speed
- MongoDB database for efficient data management
- NLP capabilities for natural language processing and understanding
- Custom, unseen features such as virus analysis to assist moderators in managing their servers

## Availability

While the bot is not currently available, we have plans to make it accessible to Discord servers of all sizes. All features will be offered for free, but we may introduce a small fee of 10 cents for servers that use the bot frequently, to help cover hosting costs. Certain premium features may also require payment from users.

## Language Support

Our project aims to gradually expand its language support to include French, English, Spanish, and more. The bot will be designed to understand natural language and respond to questions and requests, making it accessible to users worldwide.

## Premium Features

We plan to offer a chatbot function powered by GPT-4 for $1 per week. This feature will allow for 2000 tokens per week, which roughly translates to a conversation of around 1500 words. For users who require more tokens, GPT3.5 will be available for 10 times the amount of tokens and a correspondingly lower fee of $0.01 every 500 tokens.

## Our Goal

Our goal is to provide low-cost and accessible Discord bots to users worldwide. We strive to make our bot easy to use, configure, and customize, while maintaining high quality and reliable performance.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to develop and expand the capabilities of Neon Whiskers.
